Mining Seasonal Patterns in Earth Observations (Thesis)

# Abstract
Earth observations’ data of every part of the world is available at different spatial, spectral
and temporal resolutions, allowing monitoring and understanding environmental
phenomena (e.g. climate change, urbanization, desertification). These datasets are considered
as big data since they fulfill the criteria of the 3 V’s of big data: Volume, Velocity
and Variety, and thus possess great challenges of storage, management and analysis.
The Google Earth Engine (GEE), is a leading open-source analytical platform, aims to
find solutions for these challenges. Periodicity/ Seasonality detection, which refers to
the task of periodic pattern mining in time-series data, is of a great significance studying
environmental changes and predicting them. In recent years, machine-learning has
proven to be an effective way for identifying patterns in big data. This research aims at
developing a unique machine-learning-based periodicity/ seasonality detection model
for earth observations, using GEE, which will follow the subtle changes and anomalies
in time, and thus may also be useful in predicting observations. To demonstrate
this, we used 4.5 years’ data of the Israeli-Egyptian Sandfield, which exhibits unique
seasonal optical dynamics in several spectral bands, and the effects of overgazing and
human activities vs. nature conservation policy from the two sides of the border.
